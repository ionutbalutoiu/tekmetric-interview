# NOTE: These are usually commited as SOPS (https://github.com/getsops/sops)
# encrypted files. The idea is to have an encryption key that is shared with
# the team and the CI/CD pipeline service account. Access to the key is
# restricted to certain individuals. This way, the secrets are encrypted at
# rest and only decrypted when needed.
